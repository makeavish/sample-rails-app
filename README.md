# README
This is a ruby on rails sample application to demonstrate how to auto-instrument a rails application using opentelemetry.

* Ruby version: 3.1.2

* System dependencies

    ```
    gem 'opentelemetry-sdk'
    gem 'opentelemetry-exporter-otlp'
    gem 'opentelemetry-instrumentation-all'
    ```

* Start the application: 

    ```
    OTEL_EXPORTER=otlp OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=sampleRailsApp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=application=sparkapp rails server
    ```

    This runs the rails application at port 3000. Try accessing app at http://localhost:3000/

This sample app was inspired by [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-ruby-on-rails-application) article on digital ocean.
